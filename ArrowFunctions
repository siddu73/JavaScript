It's important note that, Arrow Functions are anonymouse. Which means that they are not named.

This anonymity creates some issue:
--> Harder to Debug
--> No Self reference 

Harder to Debug: When we get an error, not able to fine the name of the function or exact line number where it occurred.
No Self reference: If our function needs to have a self-reference at any point (e.g recursion, event handler that needs to unbind), 
                   it will not work.
                   
Main benefit: No binding of 'this'
